        ML or machine learning is what makes an AI application intelligent enough to learn new things. This is the broad part of AI that most industries in the world are working on.
Because of this, a computer device takes up data and with more data, it gets more intelligent. It is like feeding a human being with food that makes them stronger. Data makes a device that has used ML smart and intelligent.
Because of this, the software can learn how they need to improve and personalize themselves according to their users. ML is also used in the voice assistants because of which they can remember what wesay and search related to that.

Elements Of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be regarded as a subset of AI and has mainly two elements, namely supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Supervised Learning
This is a rather common technique for teaching systems. It is done by using a huge number of labeled examples in the form of data. The systems are filled with a large amount of data that identifies the features of interest.These are then labeled into the system’s memory. Once the system is trained, these labels can be used to read data as well as create new data.
Unsupervised Learning
It is quite different from the above method of learning as this algorithm attempts to locate patterns in data. They cluster together these patterns to perform operations and give meaningful results.
Reinforcement Learning
This is a reward-based learning process. Here, rewards are processed according to their input data. This is basically a trial and error process and is greatly used in machine learning methods.

Tasks machines solve
Some examples of artificial intelligence we can find in our daily life: so, when we open Facebook and see the content that appears in the “News” tab, there is a selection in what is shown to each user, and an algorithm makes that selection with artificial intelligence. The same as when Amazon recommends a product or book. Or surely you have seen some content that Netflix suggests to you because you saw another similar one. These examples are from the machines in the form of AI software.
Other examples are easier to see. Emotech’s assistant, Olly, is very similar to Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home, but has a fundamental difference: her personality can evolve — this is AI.
We see that artificial intelligence is linked to business, and companies are taking advantage of artificial intelligence to do their tasks faster and at a lower cost. AI is one of the most disruptive technologies of the century, and it is helping SMEs to evolve faster, especially in the field of communications, product development, and customer service.

The Future
The trends above show us that Artificial Intelligence can really be a boon for the education sector. The call should be to integrate it well within the ecosystem. There are already a number of resources helping shape up the future of education. And as time goes on, there will be even more. The possibilities to revolutionise the education sector seem endless today. And tomorrow, when AI is presented to us in its most refined iteration, it would really change the way we look at schools and colleges. It would also make for better students, and in turn better professionals that can tackle the negative aspects of AI. There are startups in the education space like Clever that are taking on education in this way already and countless more trying to break in. With this vested interest by the startup community, it’s no doubt that change is happening and AI will become more integrated very soon. AI will be a major part of that, as students, teachers and administrators all benefit from a smarter, more personalized approach to education.
